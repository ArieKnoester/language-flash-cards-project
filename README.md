# language-flash-cards-project

Work in progress.

A small application to aid in learning a new language using virtual
flash cards. Created as part of a Python course. Image and .csv
files were provided by the course.


A randomly chosen French word is displayed and the user has 3 seconds 
to guess the English translation. If they are correct, they click 
the 'check mark' button and the word is removed from the pool. If
they are incorrect, they click the 'cross' button. The word remains
in the pool and will be displayed again at some point.
